# Lab 6

1. Implement linear time selection algorithm. And use it to find the median and compare running time for random integers with faster of Merge/Heap sort for: N=10,100,1000,10000,100 000 (1 lakh), 100 00 00 (1 Million).

2. Implement Strassen's Algorithm to multiply two  2^k Ã— 2^k matrices and compare running time with the usual method for multiplying two matrices (using random integers in range 0..99) for k=4,7,9,11, 13, 15, 17
