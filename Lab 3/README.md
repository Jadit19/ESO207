# Lab 3

1. Write code to generate random integers (in suitable range). Your output should be in a file. You may use C-library routines or any method.

2. Implement insertion sort to sort integers. Your program must read numbers from a file (say that created in 1st problem). You may "hard-code" the file name or any other method you are familiar with (e.g. command line arguments). The number of items can again be either read from terminal/file/command line argument.

3. Implement heap sort to sort integers. Your program must read numbers from a file (say that created in 1st problem). You may "hard-code" the file name or any other method you are familiar with (e.g. command line arguments). The number of items can again be either read from terminal/file/command line argument.

4.  Use time command to find running time for programs 2 and 3 for N=10,100,1000,10000,100 000 (1 lakh), 100 00 00 (1 Million).
