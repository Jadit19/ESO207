1.  Implement Kruskal's Algorithm for finding Minimum Spanning Tree. This also involves implementing disjoint union-find (with path compression). Test your program for a graph (of your choice) having at least 6 vertices, number of edges should be at least twice the number of vertices. Do not hard code the graph.

2.  Implement Prim's Algorithm for MST using r-way heaps. Test your program for a graph (of your choice) having at least 6 vertices, number of edges should be at least twice the number of vertices. Do not hard code the graph.
