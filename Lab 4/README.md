# Lab 4

1. Implement bucket sort, with each bucket as a queue (implemented using linked list). You are free to (re)-use code of Lab 2.

2. Implement merge sort. You are not allowed to use recursion/pointers in this question.

3. Use time command to find running time for above programs and also heap sort (of last lab) for N=10,100,1000,10000,100 000 (1 lakh), 100 00 00 (1 Million).
